It’s lunchtime, and I’m sitting in front of Cochin hospital, taking a break. A small forlorn weed rising in a corner of the building struggles against the wind. I don’t know why, but I can’t stop looking at it. What if this plant could actually speak ? What kind of sound – or noise – would it emit ? What could we learn from it ?
Maybe it’s worth checking out. Something about this gray zone between art and science.
So I’ve decided.
« Listening to plants » as a first title.
I don’t really have any clue as to go about it. Maybe it’s really stupid as an idea. But then again, one could imagine that any living object generates some kind of vibration, and this vibration could then be translated into an audible sound.
The big idea : When I was doing a BTS Technicien Production Bois, I (we) studied some of the mechanical properties of wood. Although I haven’t retained much of the math, I was always fascinated by the idea that one could use math to explore properties of physical objects. Somewhere further back, art history studies echo also. The concept of« nature » came about only once civilisation had cut itself off from « nature ». Revisiting « nature » through digital tools reformulates this essential question about the distance between our mental constructions – civilisation - and the physical world surrounding us.
As I said, I have no clue as to how to investigate. Nevertheless, I see two paths :
1. Create artificial vibrations through external stimuli. This could be, for example, applying an electrical current or inducing a vibration through friction.
2. Measuring (and then translating into sound) internal movements, whether they be regular oscillations or non regular jumps.
Option 1 is easy and doesn’t get to the point. Option 2 is much harder but potentially more interesting.
If something could actually be measured and made « listenable », the project would ideally find its expression in a public space, a park, that would provoke passers-by. Stop, and listen to what a plant can tell you.

Louis says that he wants to join. Yay !
Found some paths to explore this morning.
On Medium, « Can you hear the stars » https://medium.com/the-white-house/can-you-hear-the-stars-7d05db6a7f4#.21e3uhr84
Astrophysicist Wanda Diaz Merced describes « techniques in sonification, or how we translate data into sound signals. Suddenly, it was possible to detect subtle changes in data patterns, simply by listening to them. »
Joel Chevrier told me that there was a show to check out at the Fondation Cartier, « Le Grand Orchestre des Animaux », inspiré par l’oeuvre de Bernie Krause, musicien et bioacousticien américain.
The dedicated web site http://www.legrandorchestredesanimaux.com is both esthetic and informative. Lots of vocabulary that gives keywords for later research, and ideas to frame out intentions.
To do : See the show, gather keywords and begin research.

Brainstorming :
Louis spoke yesterday about the reactions of plants (induced vibrations) to external sources : wind, cars etc. This is one path for interaction.


Research :
A few people already working on the idea.
