Here are more detailed instructions on how to make and use the glitter bottle toy.

Materials
clean, empty plastic bottle with screw top lid
glitter glue or craft glitter and clear, water-soluble glue
water
hot glue or crazy glue

Making the glitter bottle
1. add half inch to one inch of glitter glue to bottle (the more glue you have, the longer your glitter will take to settle when shaken)
2. add warm water, a little at a time, to slowly dilute the glitter glue
3. once the bottle is about 1/3 full with this glitter/glue/water mixture, you can finish filling it with room temperature water
4. try to make it so that there is very little air left in the bottle
5. test the time it takes the glitter to settle by shaking the bottle and timing it (I like it to take 2-5 minutes for my kindergarteners)
6. if it goes too quickly, you can pour out some of the liquid and replace it with glue diluted with water
7. if it goes too slowly, you can pour out some of the liquid and replace it with water
8. use a little hot glue or crazy glue along the inside of the bottle lid and screw it on (so that the bottle can't be opened)
